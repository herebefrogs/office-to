13:00-14:00 setup app plumbing (git repo, gh-pages, client and render HTML pages, createJS libs, firebase DB...)
14:00-15:00 basic device motion -> firebase -> render flow
15:00-16:00 multi-user flow (assign random colors, make sure single user flow scales up)
16:00-17:00 paint like rendering
20:00-21:00 presentation (resources, slidedeck)

nice to have:
- paint dripping downward (saw that somewhere, createjs lab or video?)
- number of firebase connected users
- short URL (o/logo.to) on blank canvas
