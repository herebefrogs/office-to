13:00-13:30 setup app plumbing (git repo, gh-pages, client and render HTML pages, createJS libs, firebase DB...)
13:45-21:45 basic device motion -> firebase -> render flow
21:45-22:30 paint like rendering
?-? multi-user flow (assign random colors, make sure single user flow scales up)
?-? presentation (resources, slidedeck)

TODO:
- add OANDA SVG layer
- generate acceleration vector that make sense (updating the position and generating strokes)
- randomize client startup position (or whatever)
- make releasing client press actually work
- change client UI when acceleration events are not available (or something)

nice to have:
- paint dripping downward (saw that somewhere, createjs lab or video?)
- number of firebase connected users
- background color animation on client when pressing
- short URL (o/logo.to) on blank canvas
- README.md
