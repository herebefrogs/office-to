13:00-13:30 setup app plumbing (git repo, gh-pages, client and render HTML pages, createJS libs, firebase DB...)
13:45-21:45 basic device motion -> firebase -> render flow
21:45-23:00 paint like rendering (not working)
23:00-23:30 presentation (resources, slidedeck)
next day
9:30-10:15 paint like rendering (actually working)
10:30-11:30 multi-user flow (assign random colors, make sure single user flow scales up)

TODO:
- generate acceleration vector that make sense (updating the position and generating strokes)
- randomize client startup position (or whatever)
- make releasing client press actually work
- change client UI when acceleration events are not available (or something)

nice to have:
- paint dripping downward (saw that somewhere, createjs lab or video?)
- number of firebase connected users
- background color animation on client when pressing
- short URL (o/logo.to) on blank canvas
- README.md
