13:00-13:30 setup app plumbing (git repo, gh-pages, client and render HTML pages, createJS libs, firebase DB...)
13:45-15:00 basic device motion -> firebase -> render flow
15:00-16:00 multi-user flow (assign random colors, make sure single user flow scales up)
16:00-17:00 paint like rendering
20:00-21:00 presentation (resources, slidedeck)

TODO:
- generate acceleration vector that make sense (updating the position and generating strokes)
- randomize client startup position (or whatever)
- make releasing client press actually work
- change client UI when acceleration events are not available (or something)
nice to have:
- paint dripping downward (saw that somewhere, createjs lab or video?)
- number of firebase connected users
- background color animation on client when pressing
- short URL (o/logo.to) on blank canvas
- README.md
